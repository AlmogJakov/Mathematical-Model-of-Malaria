The project aims to implement standard prediction models for malaria disease.   

It also seeks to evaluate the mosquito population measure more accurately since this measure in such models is fixed.   

We collaborated with the ZzappMalaria company, the developer of a mobile-app and managerial dashboard that helps eliminate malaria that have won IBM Watson AI XPRIZE Competition in 2022.
